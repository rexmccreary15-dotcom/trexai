# How to Find and Run Your Website File

## The File You're Looking For

The file is called **"RUN_WITH_FULL_PATH"** (Windows is hiding the `.bat` part)

You can also use the new file I created: **"START WEBSITE"**

---

## How to See File Extensions (Optional)

If you want to see the `.bat` extension:

1. **Open File Explorer**
2. Click **"View"** tab at the top
3. Check the box that says **"File name extensions"**
4. Now you'll see `.bat` at the end of files

## Which File to Use?

You have TWO files that work the same way:

1. **"RUN_WITH_FULL_PATH"** (the original)
2. **"START WEBSITE"** (newer, easier name)

**Both do the exact same thing!** Use whichever one you can find easier.

## What the File Looks Like

- **Icon**: Usually looks like a gear ⚙️ or a document with a gear
- **Name**: "RUN_WITH_FULL_PATH" or "START WEBSITE"
- **Type**: Windows Batch File (if extensions are shown)

## Still Can't Find It?

1. Make sure you're in: `C:\Users\Rexan\.cursor\cursor app`
2. Look for files that have a gear icon
3. Or look for "START WEBSITE" (easier to spot)

## Quick Test

If you find the file:
- **Double-click it**
- A black window should open
- You'll see text scrolling
- That means it's working!
